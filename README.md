# Overview
TaskTrakr is a webapp which allows users to create and add tasks to their personal TaskTrakr calendar. To use the software, a user needs to register for an account and sign-in. From their, they can click on the links on the header to view tasks, their dashboard, and a lot more. To create a task, a user needs to go to the “task” tab and select “create task.” There is some information a user will need to fill out including the time, place, and the people involved. If downloading the code directly, navigate to the directory the TaskTrakr is saved to and open an empty browser. Type 'npm start' to run the program.

# Development Environment
To use the software, we used VS Code as the environment and programmed using the React language. React is used to make Webapps that can work on both iOS and Android devices. For the backend, we used firebase to store user information. Firebase is used as a backend database to store user information for login functionality and to keep track of other information users may need such as tasks that are created and more.
